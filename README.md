A Demo Application Frontend


## Deploy Your Own
Deploy your own application with Vercel:
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/nuxtjs&template=nuxtjs)


### How We Created This Example

To get started with Nuxt.js deployed with Vercel, you can use the [Create-Nuxt-App CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-nuxt-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-nuxt-app my-app
```
